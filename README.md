### Pet Adoption Agency

This is a basic pet adoption app, where a user can view all pets in our database and see whether or not they are available for adoption. Users can also view more details about the pet, such as their age, species, name, and various notes. The availability of the pets can be changed at will. Also, we can add new pets if we choose.
